<h2>My top 5 favourite activities are as follows ...</h2>
<hr />


<h3>Check out Kokusai-Dori </h3>
<p class="a">
    As one of the more notable streets in Okinawa, Kokusai-dori is a street that stretches 1.6 kilometers through the city center. 
   This is where many tourists and locals congregate, often being a space where markets, food, and entertainment are intertwined. <br>Many visitors here also say there are good souvenir options to bring home from the country, so if you're after a last-minute gift, you want to head to Kokusai-dori. Much like any public street, people can walk around and shop throughout the week, with shops and businesses closing at varying times.

<h3>Visit Shuri Castle </h3>
<p>
    Before becoming a Japanese prefecture in 1879, Okinawa was once an independent country known as the Ryukyu Kingdom. This is why the island’s culture and history are relatively unique to the rest of the country.<br>
    Shuri Castle served as the royal palace during the kingdom’s reign and holds a special place in the history and culture of old-day Okinawa. Despite being decimated during World War II, it was rebuilt in the 90s and designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
    Today, it hosts thousands of tourists and is one of the most visited landmarks in the Okinawa prefecture.

<h3>Go on a whale watching tour </h3>
<p>
    Okinawa Island offers guests a rare opportunity to spot these remarkable gentle giants up close. From December through April, humpback whales migrate to the region’s warm waters, and a boat trip can take vacationers to the middle of the action. <br>
    <br>
    You can expect to see humpback, Bryde, and sperm whales here.

<h3>Try Snorkeling in clear water </h3>
<p>
    A trip to Okinawa is not complete without a snorkeling experience. Thanks to the clear waters and warm tropical weather, the conditions are ideal for venturing under the surface, where almost 200 of the globe’s 800 coral species await to be discovered in the waters around Okinawa.
    Fortunately, tourists don’t have to look far or wide as snorkeling hotspots abound throughout the island.

<h3>Sample The Local Cuisine         </h3>
<p>
    Japan is world-famous for its rich gastronomic traditions, and foodies will have an exciting time treating their taste buds to the local flavors. However, Okinawan cuisine differs from many parts of the country, which should incentivize tourists to try out its offerings.
    Many dishes here are closely related to Taiwanese cuisine, with pork forming the staple of most meal servings.
    Most recipes incorporate bitter melon and purple yams, which should be a unique taste for many and a new experience. Guests can also sample tasty tropical fruits like papaya and dragon fruit.
    <br>
    Okinawa is known for its fresh sea food and authentic recipes.
